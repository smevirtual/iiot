### About the SME

The SME is an international organization which seeks to develop engineering and manufacturing talent, promote advanced manufacturing
technology and, ultimately, build a more prosperous tomorrow for the manufacturing community.

### About the SME Virtual Network

The SME Virtual Network is a volunteer-led online community for SME members, non-members, emerging professionals and students. It was created to engage remote areas that do not have the support of a local SME chapter; busy community members who may not have the time to participate in face-to-face events; and manufacturing professionals who do shift work.

In short, itâ€™s designed to enhance the traditional SME chapter experience. We strive to provide value-added virtual events and engagement opportunities for the manufacturing and engineering community. Post-event discussions will take place SME Connect and an instant messaging platform called Slack.
